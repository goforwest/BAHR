│   $19/mo   │   $49/mo    │   $0      │
│            │  ⭐ POPULAR  │           │
└────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
```

**Why Professional in middle:**
- Anchor at $49 makes $19 feel like a bargain

---

### 3.4 Value-Based Messaging

#### For Researchers
**"Finish your dissertation 100x faster"**
- Manual analysis: 500 verses × 10 min = **83 hours**
- BAHR analysis: 500 verses × 5 sec = **42 minutes**
- Time savings: **82 hours = 2 full work weeks**
- Cost: $19/month = **$0.23 per hour of time saved**

**vs. Hiring Expert:**
- Expert analysis: $75/hour × 83 hours = **$6,225**
- BAHR: $19/month = **$228/year**
- Savings: **$5,997** (96% cheaper)

#### For Publishers

- BAHR: 100 submissions × 1 sec = **2 minutes** (batch upload)
- Time savings: 25 hours = **$750-1,250 per competition**
- Cost: $49/month = **Pays for itself in first competition**

#### For Institutions
**"$3,500/year = $0.07 per student"**
- Annual cost: $3,500

   - CTA: "Upgrade now for unlimited analysis - $19/month"

2. **Approaching limit:**
   - At 7 verses: "3 analyses remaining this month. Upgrade for unlimited?"
   - Email: "You're almost at your limit. Upgrade to Researcher tier today!"

3. **Hit limit end-of-month:**
   - "Limit reached. Resets in 5 days, or upgrade now for immediate access"

**Professional → Enterprise/Institutional:**

1. **High usage:**
   - 40,000+ API calls/month: "You're approaching Business tier volume. Upgrade for 50% per-call savings"

2. **Team size:**
   - More than 5 users: "Need more seats? Contact us for institutional licensing"

3. **Custom features:**
   - Feature requests: "Need custom features? Available on Enterprise tier"

### 4.3 Retention & Churn Prevention

**Churn Risk Indicators:**
- No usage in 30 days: **High risk**
- Downgrade from Professional → Researcher: **Medium risk**
- Cancelled annual auto-renewal: **High risk**

**Retention Tactics:**

1. **Re-engagement campaigns:**
   - Day 30 no usage: "We miss you! Here's what's new in BAHR..."
   - Day 60: "Need help? Let's set up a 15-min call to maximize your BAHR usage"
   - Day 90: "Special retention offer: 50% off next 3 months"

2. **Downgrade offers:**
   - Cancelling user: "Would you stay for 30% off?" (retention discount)
   - "Downgrade to Researcher instead?" (save some revenue vs. full churn)

3. **Exit surveys:**
   - "Why are you leaving?" (improve product based on feedback)
   - Options: Too expensive, Not using enough, Found alternative, Quality issues

4. **Win-back campaigns:**
   - 3 months after cancel: "We've added new features. Come back for 1 month free!"
   - 6 months: "Your research data is still here. Reactivate today!"

3. **Case study template:**
   - Institution name
   - Challenge (before BAHR)
   - Solution (how they use BAHR)

## CONCLUSION

**Recommended Pricing Strategy:**
- ✅ **Freemium model** with generous free tier (10 verses/month)
- ✅ **Researcher tier: $19/month** - competitive with academic tool market
- ✅ **Professional tier: $49/month** - clear value for teams/publishers
- ✅ **Institutional licenses: $1,500-7,500/year** - aligned with academic software pricing
- ✅ **API tiers: $299-2,999+/month** - standard API SaaS pricing
- ✅ **Academic discounts: 30%** - build future customer base
- ✅ **Annual discounts: 16.7%** - encourage commitment, improve cash flow

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- **Value-based, not cost-plus:** Price reflects value delivered (time savings, accuracy, credibility), not development costs
- **Market-aligned:** Comparable to Grammarly ($12-30/month), Writefull ($5-10/month), academic databases ($2k-50k/year)
- **Accessible:** Free tier removes barriers, student discounts ensure affordability
- **Scalable:** Clear upgrade path from free → $19 → $49 → institutional → enterprise

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Stripe subscription billing (Month 1-2)
2. Build pricing page with tier comparison (Month 2)
3. Launch with aggressive growth pricing (Months 3-6)
4. A/B test pricing variations (Months 7-9)
5. Optimize based on conversion data (Months 10-12)
