# BAHR Documentation Archive

## Purpose

This directory contains **historical documentation** that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for:
- **Audit trail**: Tracking project evolution and decisions
- **Retrospectives**: Learning from past milestones and blockers
- **Reference**: Understanding context behind architectural decisions

**Status:** All files in this archive are **READ-ONLY** and considered **completed/superseded**.

## Why These Files Were Archived

### Archival Criteria
Files were archived if they met one or more of the following criteria:

1. **Obsolete**: Describes completed one-time work (e.g., specific milestone completions)
2. **Superseded**: Replaced by updated or consolidated documentation
3. **Historical**: Valuable for context but not needed for active development
4. **Redundant**: Content duplicated in active tracking systems (e.g., PROGRESS_LOG.md)

### Not Deletion - Archival
**Important:** No documentation was deleted. All files were **moved to this archive** to:
- ✅ Preserve institutional knowledge
- ✅ Maintain audit trail
- ✅ Enable retrospectives and learning
- ✅ Reduce clutter in active documentation

---

## Archive Maintenance

### Adding New Files
When archiving additional files:
